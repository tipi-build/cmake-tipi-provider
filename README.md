# tipi-cmake-provider: Automatic build caching for CMake FetchContent 
**tipi.build ‚ù§Ô∏è CMake**


[tipi](https://tipi.build/documentation/0050-getting-started-cpp) is a Git connected automatic build cache for CMake which is configurable with a JSON file named [`.tipi/deps`](https://tipi.build/documentation/0700-dependencies) to define CMake build dependencies.

This JSON file is not a native way for CMake natives to express themselves, for this reason we have created **tipi-cmake-provider**, that allows to express any dependencies with the best CMake Package Manager out there **FetchContent**.

**Advantages :**
  - Without changes `FetchContent` is automatically cached.
  - `tipi . -t linux -u` injects automatically the tipi-cmake-provider. 
  - CMakeLists.txt stays fully compatible without tipi just with plain CMake


## How to use it ?
Exactly as the CMake FetchContent documentation requires, the build will just be cached and faster to restore.

1. üöÄ Install the latest [`tipi` release](https://github.com/tipi-build/cli)
2. Run the CMake build via : `tipi . -t linux|macos|windows -u`

```cmake
Include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    Boost
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/boostorg/boost.git
    GIT_TAG        32da69a36f84c5255af8a994951918c258bac601 # Boost 1.80
    )
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(Boost)
find_package(boost_filesystem CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_executable(app boost.cpp)
target_link_libraries(app Boost::filesystem)
```

## How does it work ?
The speedup comes from the fact that instead of using `add_subdirectory` by default as plain FetchContent does, it runs the build of the dependency in a separate CMake context with tipi git mirroring based caching and installs the build artifacts in a dependency-specific sysroot.

When a cache entry is found, as it does not rely on CMake adding the subdirectory as part of the build, it doesn't need to fetch the sources but simply the build artifacts.

Fetching the sources in big project can be slow, but also having to provide the exact same environments for the build to happen to get the built artifacts can also be an issue, tipi's smart caching is based on an [ABI-hash](https://tipi.build/documentation/1000-build-cache) computation, that behaves as if the project was built from sources but without the cost of building if it was already done by a peer [in the same team](https://tipi.build/documentation/1100-shared-cache), or present on the curated [central tipi cache](https://tipi.build).

If compile flags changes in an incompatible way, the build will be performed fully from sources again.
